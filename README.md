# Music In JPG
## 0x01 Introduction
Basically it is just my... imagination?
I think that JPG and zip have their own magic number, then if I can place musics in a archive and append into the JPG file?
After some tries and search on internet, I succedd, however I found that there are already some ways to do it on internet.
However don't know why sometimes those methods cannot be used, so I still decided to post it.
## 0x02 Usage
There will be a file called "music_track.py" (well, there's no GUI this time)
When you run this script, it will ask you for a picture (can be the picture proceed or a JPEG picture)
And it will jump into a fake "interaction shell"
You can input some command into it
Input help will result in
```add - Add songs to SoundTrack
rem - Remove songs from SoundTrack
save - Save changes and exit
exit - Discard changes and exit```
