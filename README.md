# Music In JPG
## 0x01 Introduction
Basically it is just my... imagination?<br>
I think that JPG and zip have their own magic number, then if I can place musics in a archive and append into the JPG file?<br>
After some tries and search on internet, I succedd, however I found that there are already some ways to do it on internet.<br>
However don't know why sometimes those methods cannot be used, so I still decided to post it.<br>
## 0x02 Usage
There will be a file called "music_track.py" (well, there's no GUI this time)<br>
When you run this script, it will ask you for a picture (can be the picture proceed or a JPEG picture)<br>
And it will jump into a fake "interaction shell"<br>
You can input some command into it<br>
Input help will result in<br>
```add - Add songs to SoundTrack
rem - Remove songs from SoundTrack
save - Save changes and exit
exit - Discard changes and exit```
