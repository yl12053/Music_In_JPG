# Music In JPG
## 0x01 Introduction
Basically it is just my... imagination?
I think that JPG and zip have their own magic number, then if I can place musics in a archive and append into the JPG file?
After some tries and search on internet, I succedd, however I found that there are already some ways to do it on internet.
However don't know why sometimes those methods cannot be used, so I still decided to post it.
